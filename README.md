# AUV-Simulator
This repo contains MATLAB code along with a Simulink visualization .xlx file for an underwater simulation of an autonomous underwater vehicle using a high-level mission planner. Please change working directories in the code according to your needs.

In order to run 2020's navigation stack, you will need to download the Casadi library (available at: https://web.casadi.org/) and include the library's directory in the repo's main directory. The folder is so large so I couldn't upload it to the repo.
